# Lecture & Computer lab reading

- [PsyTeachR Chapter on Prgramming Basics](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/programming-basics.html)
- [R for Data Science chapter on Workflow](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics)
  - will cover this in more detail in the lab and as we progress on the course


# Session objectives

- Show you how to set up a project in R
- Show you how to create subdirectories in your project
- Cover some basic principles of programming R
- What we don't finish today we can revisit in the computer lab
- **Feel free to discuss your code with your neighbour if you're stuck**


# Computer lab objectives (for Thursday)

- Pick up where to finish today in this session
- Focus on creating an RMarkdown document


# Using projects

-   In R, we create projects which become the directories for our work
-   It's a bit like having a folder for each of your subjects/projects.
-   Make sure you name your projects appropriately
-   Unless you are adding a project to another related project, use the
    `New Directory` option and fill out the required details


# Some important rules about directories in R

-   **DO NOT create a folder called 'R'**, as this is the default title R
    gives to its own namespace, which will lead to conflicts and unusual
    behaviour
-   Good practice is to create R projects in designated project folders,
    and I will show you how to do this
-   Creating an `.RProj` creates a project directory, avoiding any
    potential confusion R may experience when switching between projects

    
## DEMO: Setting up a project in R

- Let's set up our project and create
- We'll create an R script today for the exercise, but we'll move over to RMarkdown files come the tutorial.
- Call your R script "intro_to_R.R"


# Create sub-directories

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Relevance

-   Once you are in to your new project you need to create a set of
    useful folders
-   To do so, type the following code lines one at a time into the
    Console and press enter
- We will be adding files to these folders throughout the course

### Code

```{r eval = F}

# Create subdirectories

dir.create("data_raw")
dir.create("data_tidy")
dir.create("fig_output")

```

## DEMO: Basic R programming

```{r basics, eval=FALSE}

# Using operators

3 + 5

12/7

# Assigning variables

x <- 5

7 -> x

```

----

```{r basics 2, eval=F}

# some simple maths

x <- 23

y <- 67

area_rect <- x * y

```

# Before I continue, do you have any questions?

----

```{r basics 3, eval=F}

# BMI

height <- 1.8

weight <- 80

bmi <- 
  (weight/(height*height)) # write over 2 lines to keep things tidy  

bmi <- 
  (height/(weight*weight))

```

# R Functions

```{r functions, eval=F}

# Using functions

sqrt(4)

a <- 49

sqrt(a)

round(3.14159)

args(round) # shows you the format of the function input

round(3.14159, digits = 2)

```

# Vectors and data types

```{r vectors, eval=F}

test_scores <-
  c(3, 5, 2, 8, 7) # use concatenate to create a vector of (numeric) values

test_scores

students <-
  c("Roland", "Sophie", "Max", "Teresa", "Mandy") # use concatenate to create a vector of (character) values

# length function
length(test_scores)

# class function
class(students)

```


# Given what you have learned above, what do you think the following code does?

```{r question, eval = F}

students <-
  c(students, "Dennis")

```


# Futher exercises (time dependent)

```{r mixed data, eval = F}

# Mixed data types ----

test_answers <-
  c("a", 5, 8, TRUE, 3i)

class(test_answers)

str(test_answers)

```

----

```{r subsetting, eval = F}

# Sub-setting vectors ----

test_answers

test_answers[2]

test_answers[c(3, 2)]

test_answers[c(9, 23, 5)]

```

----

```{r cond subsetting, eval=F}

# Conditional sub-setting

test_scores <-
  c(test_scores, 10, 2, 1, 3, 6)

test_scores > 3

test_scores[test_scores > 3]

test_scores[test_scores <= 2 | test_scores == 6]

students[students == "Max" | students == "Mandy"]

```

# Cleanup

```{r cleanup, eval=F}

# Clear data
rm(list = ls())  # Removes all objects from environment

# Clear packages
p_unload(all)  # Remove all contributed packages

# Clear plots
graphics.off()  # Clears plots, closes all graphics devices

# Clear console
cat("\014")  # Mimics ctrl+L

```

# Summary

- Set up an R project (.RProj file)
- Created relevant subdirectories for the course (for use later on)
- Covered some basics of R programming using an R script to give you some hands on experience programming in R

# Computer lab

- Creating RMarkdown files
- Writing text and code in RMarkdown
- Writing tidy code (in more detail)
