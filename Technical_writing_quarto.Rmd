# Technical writing in Quarto

-   You can add mathematical and technical symbols to Quarto reports.

-   The easiest way to do this is through the Insert -\> LaTeX Math -\> Inline Math.

-   This will create a wrapper with dollar symbols ($X$)

-   [Then you need to refer to this sheet of LaTeX symbols to input your text or formula](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols).
