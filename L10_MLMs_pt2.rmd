# Source for today's follow up

- [This video on multi-level modelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQmYzCYuD1k&t=4931s)

# Exmaple 

Say we spcify the following model to predict language tet score based on gender and whether the school is public or private.

```{r, eval = F}

test_score ~ gender_student + school_type

```
 
We can deconstruct the data for MLM analysis like so 

- DV: test score
- IV1: gender of student
- IV2: school type
- Cluster variable: school number (multiple schools within school type)
- Level 1: gender of student (each test score is matched to a gender)
- Level 2: school type (multiple language scores matched to a school type)

# MLM equations (again)

Level 1

$Y_{sd} = \beta_{0s} + \beta_{1s}X_{sd} + e_{sd}$

- $Y_{sd}$: predicted score for DV for ppt *s* at level 2 
- $\beta_{0s}$: intercept (for levels of level 2 *d*)
- $\beta_{1s}$: slope for level 1 (and could include different slopes)
- $X_{sd}$: Level 1 predicted score for ppt *s* who is in level 2 *d* 
- $e_{sd}$: error for participant *s* who is in Level 2*d*

----

Level 2 (random intercept)

$\beta_{0s} = \gamma_{0} + S_{0s}$
