## Realistic data in research

-   A core strength to using a programming language for data processing
    and analysis is that you reduce the risk of human error
    significantly.
-   This is especially important when confronted with realistic datasets
    that may be untidy for historical or procedural reasons (e.g., a
    database that is maintained by different people who used their
    own unique way of storing and labelling things).
-   An option would be to simply open the data and update the values as
    an when required.
-   However, if the issue is prevalent across many datasets then an
    automated solution is more efficient.

## Today's demonstration

-   We are going to build on what we achieved last session
-   We will be learning a few more tidying operations
-   Then well look at ways to explore and summarise our data

## To get started

-   Open the script you have been working on
-   We are going to continue to work with the
    "robot-expression-data_raw.csv" file
-   To get us back to where we were, run the script in its entirety
-   **Remember** you you only ever need to install packages once (unless
    you are using a different machine) so be sure to comment
    installation commands out

```{r}

# install.packages('tidyverse')
# install.packages('psych')

# Only run these in the console if you haven't already previously

```

# Data exploration

- Here are a few handy functions to exploring your data
  - `summary`: from base R
  - `headTail`: from *psych*
  - `skim`: from *skimr*
  
## `summary` function

- The `summary` function summarises continuous and categorical vectors 
- NOTE: `summary` will not count character vectors, that's why we specified that our categorical vectors were factor type (e.g., "f") at `read_csv`

```{r results='markup'}

# data summary - overall
df |>
  summary()

```
  

## Headtail

- The `headTail` function from the *psyche* package

```{r results='markup'}

# data summary - head
headTail(df)

```

# Old school subsetting

```{r results='markup'}

# data summary - head specific
  # for specific columns, e.g., cols 1, 5, and 7
head(df[, c(1,5,7)])

```

# Skim

- The `skim` function from *skimr* gives you a good overview of the data

```{r results='markup'}

# data summary - tail
skim(df)


```

## Using summary functions with the tidyverse

- You can pipe data into summary functions to specify rows or cols of interest

```{r results='markup'}

# data summary - sex
df |>
  select(sex) |>
  summary()

```


## Recode variable levels 

- You may have noticed from the last session that there there are some erroneous values in the sex vector.
- You can check this directly by using the `$` symbol to index the vector of interest in combination with the function `unique`. 

```{r results = 'markup'}

# Check all unique entries in the vector `sex`
unique(df$sex) # we can use the `unique` function to check all of the unique values in a vector

# Alternatively you can use tidyverse's `distinct`
# df |>
#   select(sex) |>
#   distinct()

```

-   As you can see, something has gone wrong in the labelling of sex:
    there should only be two values, "Female" and "Male"


## Using `case_match` to recode data

- Previously, the `recode` function was used in combination with `mutate` to recode values in a cell
- But more recently, people have moved to using `case_match`, as it is more intuitive and user friendly
- [Info on case_match](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_match.html) 
    

```{r}

# Using case_match to recode cell values
df2 <-
  df |>  # create new and tidy object for illustration                
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex,              # mutate to change
                      "male" ~ "Male",  # supply erroneous value and new value
                      "ffemale" ~ "Female",
                      "femalew" ~ "Female",
                      .default = sex)) # preserve all other entries in the vector

# Check the values of a vector using unique
unique(df2$sex) # again, we use the $ symbol to isolate a specific vector


```


# Data object considerations

- **NOTE**: If you have assigned transformations to an object with the same original name (e.g., `df` <- `df`) that object is irreversibly overwritten, unless you go back to a previous line that created it from scratch (e.g., where it was read in )
- That is why your code operations must flow logically from top to bottom, otherwise future operations on the data will not work. 
  - e.g., You might ask R to look up a column that changed name earlier in the script, which would throw an error.
- The alternative strategy is to give each new object a different name, like `df1`. If you pursue this method, it is worth adding a comment next to each new object specifying how it is different to the previous. 

```{r, eval = F}

df1 <- # this object only contains data about ppt id and eth
  df |>
  select(id, eth)

```

## Save your tidy data

- Once you are satisfied with the amendments made to your data you can save it as a new tidy `.csv` file
- Again, use comments and bookmarks to signpost this part of your script

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# save your new data object into `data_tidy`
write_csv(df, # name of the object
          "data_out/robot-expression-data_tidy.csv") # desired directory

```
