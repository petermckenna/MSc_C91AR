# Reading for Today's session

-   [Intro to R](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/intro-to-r.html)
    -   Covers the basics of working directories in R
    -   **Reminder: we are not using the R server on this course**
-   [Chapter 4 Workflow: code style](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style)
    -   Covers the basics of code formatting
-   Why did I ask you to read this?
    -   These chapters provide valuable advice about how to set up your
        project and format your code.
    -   The principles covered here will be the building blocks for your
        R journey and will make life a lot easier for you in the long-term.
        
    
# Encountering messy code

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center', results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/messy_bedroom.jpg")        
```

- What can you tell me about this bedroom?
- How does this image make you feel?

# What are we going to cover today?

- This is a hybrid session, involving both lecturing and coding
- Setting up a project in R and relevant directories
- Learning and applying good coding practice
- Read in and quickly explore a dataset
- Outline plans for Tutorial 1

# Good Housekeeping

- Whilst you might be keen to get started with coding right away, I
    feel it's important to teach you about good practice from the outset.
- In this session, I'm going to cover a set of principles about how to
    format your code so that it is easy to read for others, and
    therefore, easy to interpret, run, and replicate if required.
- This is especially important these days as reproducible science is
    becoming more important in the social science.

# Using projects

-   In R, we create projects which become the directories for our work
-   It's a bit like having a folder for each of your subjects.
-   Make sure you name your projects appropriately
-   Unless you are adding a project to another related project, use the
    `New Directory` option and fill out the required details

# Adding folders

-   Once you are in to your new project you need to create a set of
    useful folders
-   To do so, type the following code lines one at a time into the
    Console and press enter

```{r dir_folders, eval=F}
dir.create("data_raw") # for all raw data
dir.create("data_tidy") # for all processed/tidy data
dir.create("fig_out")  # for figures
```

-   This process ensures that you have a specific directory for a
    project and a set of folders ready for your work.
-   You can add other folders or amend their names if you wish, but for
    now stick to these suggestions

# Saving data in your directory

-   Once you have set up your directories, save your experiment data
    into the "data_raw" folder.
-   The best format for R is to save data as a `.csv` but there are
    options to read in other file formats (e.g., `.xlsx`).
-   Unprocessed data is saved in the "data_raw" folder and processed
    data in the "data_tidy" folder so that we the raw and processed data
    separate
-   This will save you a lot of headache once you get to grips with
    processing data and creating new `.csv`s for different purposes.

## Save the raw data provided

-   I have provided some untidy raw data for exercises in C91AR
-   Save the data from Canvas "robot-expression-data_raw" into the
    "data_raw" folder

# Tidy code principles

-   For a detailed overview of good coding in R see [this chapter in R
    for Data Science V2](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style).
    -   Focus on how the code is formatted, not the content (for now).
-   Good commenting using `#` is essential when writing in R
-   Also, you can use four dashes `----` to bookmark sections of your R
    script
    -   Note, this applies to R code chunks, not the Markdown file


# Some examples

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Naming variables

```{r, eval = F}

# load data
library(nycflights13)

# Strive for:
short_flights <- 
  flights |> filter(air_time < 60)

# Avoid:
SHORTFLIGHTS <- flights |> filter(air_time < 60)

```

### Spaces

```{r, eval = F}

# In this code the author has aligned the "=" sign, giving better readability
flights |> 
  mutate(
    speed      = distance / air_time,
    dep_hour   = dep_time %/% 100,
    dep_minute = dep_time %%  100
  )

```

### Pipes

```{r, eval = F}

# Strive for 
flights |>  
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(tailnum)) |> 
  count(dest)

# Avoid
flights|>filter(!is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(tailnum))|>count(dest)


```

### Long, tidy command chains

```{r, eval = F}

flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  summarize(
    distance = mean(distance),
    speed = mean(distance / air_time, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = speed)) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "loess",
    span = 0.5,
    se = FALSE, 
    color = "white", 
    linewidth = 4
  ) +
  geom_point()

```

# Some reflections

- Why do you think tidy code is important?
- What challenges do you foresee in the implementation of tidy code principles?


# Load packcages for the session

-   Let's read in the expression data and use the principles of tidy
    code in the process of doing so

```{r read in data, }

# Load packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(summarytools)

```


# Read in and explore the robot expression data

```{r}

# Read in raw data
df <- # <- is the 'assign' operator 
  read_csv("data_raw/robot-expression-data_raw.csv")

```

- Now the data from the csv is stored in an object called `df`

# Explore the data

```{r}

# Examine the dataset 
glimpse(df) # glimpse provides a summary of the column/vector names, their data type. and the raw values
# Notice that it only presents a subset of the data

# Use summary tools to get an overview of the data
dfSummary(df)


```

# Summary
