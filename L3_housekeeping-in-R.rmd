# Reading for Today's session

-   [Intro to R](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/intro-to-r.html)
    -   Covers the basics of working directories in R
    -   **Reminder: we are not using the R server on this course**
-   [Chapter 4 Workflow: code style](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style)
    -   Covers the basics of code formatting
-   Why did I ask you to read this?
    -   These chapters provide valuable advice about how to set up your
        project and format your code.
    -   The principles covered here will be the building blocks for your
        R journey and will make life a lot easier for you in the long-term.
        
    
# Encountering messy code

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center', results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/messy_bedroom.jpg")        
```

- What can you tell me about this bedroom?
- How does this image make you feel?

# What are we going to cover today?

- This is a hybrid session, involving both lecturing and coding
- Setting up a project in R and relevant directories
- Learning and applying good coding practice
- Read in and quickly explore a dataset
- Outline plans for Tutorial 1

# Good Housekeeping

- Whilst you might be keen to get started with coding right away, I
    feel it's important to teach you about good practice from the outset.
- In this session, I'm going to cover a set of principles about how to
    format your code so that it is easy to read for others, and
    therefore, easy to interpret, run, and replicate if required.
- This is especially important these days as reproducible science is
    becoming more important in the social science.

# Using projects

-   In R, we create projects which become the directories for our work
-   It's a bit like having a folder for each of your subjects.
-   Make sure you name your projects appropriately
-   Unless you are adding a project to another related project, use the
    `New Directory` option and fill out the required details

# Adding folders

-   Once you are in to your new project you need to create a set of
    useful folders
-   To do so, type the following code lines one at a time into the
    Console and press enter

```{r dir_folders, eval=F}
dir.create("data_raw") # for all raw data
dir.create("data_tidy") # for all processed/tidy data
dir.create("fig_out")  # for figures
```

-   This process ensures that you have a specific directory for a
    project and a set of folders ready for your work.
-   You can add other folders or amend their names if you wish, but for
    now stick to these suggestions

# Saving data in your directory

-   Once you have set up your directories, save your experiment data
    into the "data_raw" folder.
-   The best format for R is to save data as a `.csv` but there are
    options to read in other file formats (e.g., `.xlsx`).
-   Unprocessed data is saved in the "data_raw" folder and processed
    data in the "data_tidy" folder so that we the raw and processed data
    separate
-   This will save you a lot of headache once you get to grips with
    processing data and creating new `.csv`s for different purposes.

## Save the raw data provided

-   I have provided some untidy raw data for exercises in C91AR
-   Save the data from Canvas "robot-expression-data_raw" into the
    "data_raw" folder

# Tidy code principles

-   For a detailed overview of good coding in R see [this chapter in R
    for Data Science V2](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style).
    -   Focus on how the code is formatted, not the content (for now).
-   Good commenting using `#` is essential when writing in R
-   Also, you can use four dashes `----` to bookmark sections of your R
    script
    -   Note, this applies to R code chunks, not the Markdown file


# Some examples

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Naming variables

```{r, eval = F}

# load data
library(nycflights13)

# Strive for:
short_flights <- 
  flights |> filter(air_time < 60)

# Avoid:
SHORTFLIGHTS <- flights |> filter(air_time < 60)

```

### Spaces

```{r, eval = F}

# In this code the author has aligned the "=" sign, giving better readability
flights |> 
  mutate(
    speed      = distance / air_time,
    dep_hour   = dep_time %/% 100,
    dep_minute = dep_time %%  100
  )

```

### Pipes

```{r, eval = F}

# Strive for 
flights |>  
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(tailnum)) |> 
  count(dest)

# Avoid
flights|>filter(!is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(tailnum))|>count(dest)


```

### Long, tidy command chains

```{r, eval = F}

flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  summarize(
    distance = mean(distance),
    speed = mean(distance / air_time, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = speed)) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "loess",
    span = 0.5,
    se = FALSE, 
    color = "white", 
    linewidth = 4
  ) +
  geom_point()

```

# Some reflections

- Why do you think tidy code is important?
- What challenges do you foresee in the implementation of tidy code principles?


# Load packcages for the session

-   Let's read in the expression data and use the principles of tidy
    code in the process of doing so

```{r read in data, }

# Load packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(summarytools)

```


# Read in and explore the robot expression data

```{r}

# Read in raw data
df <- # <- is the 'assign' operator 
  read_csv("data_raw/robot-expression-data_raw.csv")

```

- Now the data from the csv is stored in an object called `df`

# Explore the data

```{r}

# Examine the dataset 
glimpse(df) # glimpse provides a summary of the column/vector names, their data type. and the raw values
# Notice that it only presents a subset of the data

# Use summary tools to get an overview of the data
dfSummary(df)


```

# C91AR \| Housekeeping in R \| Lab

## What we are going to cover

-   Today's lab is a follow on from what we covered in the lecture
-   We're going to go a little deeper into good housekeeping, by
    introducing some of the tidying principles I cover in next weeks
    lecture
    -   setting column data types
    -   generate an overall summary of the data
    -   tidy vector labels
    -   rename vector labels
    -   deal with date vectors

# Setting col types

-   One of the most important things you'll do when reading in data is
    to specify the data type of each column.
-   If you don't do this properly from the outset it can lead to some
    weird behaviour from R later on, and force you to reverse engineer
    your code.
-   Proper use of the `col_types` argument in the function `read_csv` is
    here to help thankfully.
-   This should be used in conjunction with a datasets metadata file, so
    that you know which data type to assign to each vector

<!--

# Expression dataset metadata

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   `ID_` = participant id
-   `sex` = participant sex
-   `eth` = participant ethnicity
-   `eng` = "Is English your native language?"
-   `Exp.date` = date of experiment
-   `interact.before` = "Have you ever interacted wtih a robot before?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   `Alyx.is` = participants guess of robot's gender
-   `item` = plastic food item offered to robot
-   `Expression` = a numeric value for each of the four robot facial
    expressions
-   `resp` = name of the box where participants placed the food item
    after robot expression
-   `Time` = robots onboard clock timer
-   `resp_acc` = accuracy of responses according to theoretically
    deigned expressions
:::
:::

-->

# Data types for the `col_types` argument

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   "l" = logical
-   "i" = integer
-   "d" = double numeric
-   "c" = character
-   "D" = date
-   "\_" = skip
-   "?" = guess
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- For more information see the `read_csv` and `col_types` documentation in the help section
- You can pull this up by running `?read_csv` into the console  
  + I'd recommend consulting the descriptor info at the top then skipping to the examples at the bottom of the help sheet 
:::
:::

# Setting col types within the `read_csv` function

```{r set col types, eval=FALSE}

# Read in data and supply data type argument
df <-
  read_csv("data_raw/robot-expression-data_raw.csv",
           col_types = "ffff?ffffftf")

```


# Summarising data using summarytools::dfSummary

- To run summaryDf() you'll need to install and load `summarytools`
- Based on what we've discussed to this point, how would you go about doing this?

```{r, eval = F}

# Summarise df
dfSummary(df)

```

## Group discussion

- Take some time to interpret the output of `dfSummary(df)`.
- What data types are in the tibble?
- Is there anything *messy* about the data?

<!-- 

```{r, eval = F}
 
# Some examples of Tidy code for R scripts

# Project: Project title
# Outline purpose of script

# load packages
libray(tidyverse)

# keep object names lower_case_and_separated_by_underscores
star_wars <- 
starwars # starwars data is included in tidyverse

# examine data
glimpse(star_wars)

# when the pipeline is to long for one line, place arguments on new line
star_wars |>
  select(name,
         sex
         gender) # select cols name, sex, gender

# Remember, you can also add bookmarks using four dashes to mark different sections and these will appear in the navigation panel next to your script. 


```

-->

# Dealing with awkardly formatted column/vector headings

-   You'll notice that the names for columns (or vectors as they are
    known to programmers) are formatted unusually

```{r head formatting, eval=TRUE}

# Examine vector labelling
names(df)

```

# Inconsistencies worth noting

-   Use of periods and underscore as separator
-   Lower-case and upper-case font
-   Names that lack detail for others
    -   e.g., `resp`; does that refer to the participant response or the
        robot's?

## Load the necessary packages for today

```{r load packages, warning=F, eval = F}

# load packages
library(snakecase) 

```

-   I would add this to your bookmarked "load packages" section at the
    beginning of your script

# Tidying column names with `snakecase` package

- We can use the `snakecase` package to apply uniform formatting to column names
- This addresses the point made earlier about consistent variable names    

```{r tidy headings}

# Tidy column headings using snakecase
  # these functions come from the snakecase package we loaded earlier
names(df) <- 
  to_snake_case(names(df)) # lower_case with underlined separators 

# examine the data
names(df) # notice how the cols are formatted now

```

<!--

# Check-point

-   Be sure to add descriptive comments to your code chunks
-   If you're writing code in R scripts then adding these to RMarkdown, add bookmarks with four dashes after a comment
-   Code vertically by using paragraphs at the end of an argument

-->

# Changing vector names

-   You can also change the names of vectors using the `rename` function
-   Note, `rename` asks for the new vector name followed by the old one
    -   this takes a little getting used to but its simple after enough
        practice

```{r renaming vectors}

# Rename vectors using rename
df <-
  df |>
  rename(perceived_robot_gender = alyx_is, # the new labels are intended to be more descriptive
         robot_expression = expression,
         ppt_acc = resp_acc)

# Examine changes
names(df)

```

- **Remember, using the assign operator as above will irreversably amend your tibble.**
- If you feel this is necessary proceed, but if not consider creating a new tibble object.

# Dealing with the date column

-   Dates are notoriously difficult to deal with in R and our date
    vector could not be read properly
-   Thankfully there is a really useful package that simplifies
    everything; the aptly named `lubridate`
-   It is already loaded as part of the Tidyverse
-   Take a look at [lubridate here](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)

# Lubridate to sort out date column

```{r dates and lubridate}

df <-
  df |> # this is the pipe operator; it means, "then do this"
  mutate(exp_date = dmy(exp_date)) # mutate is a function that allows you to append or modify existing columns/vectors in a dataset

# Examine data
glimpse(df)

```

- The date column should now be properly machine ready formatted (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD), based on the input formatting (i.e., dd/mm/yyyy)
- The machine readable format YYY-MM-DD is preferable for almost all programming languages.
- In this format, you can ask R to make nuanced calculations between dates.

# What did we cover in this lab

-   Setting column data types with the `col_types` argument
-   Generating an overall summary of the data with `summary`
-   Tidy vector labels with `snakecase`
-   Rename vector labels with `rename`
-   Dealing with date vectors using `lubridate`


# Using RMarkdown or Quarto

# Learning about Correlation through Data Simulation

```{r warning=FALSE}

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(corrr)
library(psych)
library(GGally)

# Read in the data
handw <-
  read_csv("data_raw/heights_and_weights.csv")
```

## Examine the data

```{r}

# Examine the data
glimpse(handw)
head(handw)
tail(handw)
```

The heights and weights dataset contains 475 observations and 2 vectors: `height_in` and `weight_lbs`.

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r}

# Gather means and SDs of handw
describe(handw)

```

The mean of height in inches was 62.91 (SD=12.12). The mean for weight in pounds was 132.28 (SD=54.19). Measures of both skew (-1.78) and kurtosis (2.89) indicate that height in inches was not normally distributed.

## Plot the distribution of height in inches

```{r}

# Generate a histrogram of height in inches
ggplot(data = handw,
       mapping = aes(x = height_in)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Histrogram of the distribution of height in inches",
       x = "\nHeight in inches",
       y = "Frequency\n")

```

## Copying and pasting code

```{r}
tibble(
  height_cm = rnorm(30, mean = 179, sd = 13),   # generate data on a normal distribution
  weight_kg = rnorm(30, mean = 78, sd = 5)) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 0) %>%  # remove decimals for simplicity
  mutate(id = row_number())                     # add an id column based on the row number  
```
