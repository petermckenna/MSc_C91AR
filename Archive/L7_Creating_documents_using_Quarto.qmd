# Outline for today

-   Cover the basics of Quarto
-   Show you how this is made easier using Quarto
-   Demonstrate how to compose a Quarto document
-   Code along demo

# Essentials

-   Install Quarto: [Get started with
    Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
-   `R` and `RStudio` must also be installed.

# Why are we covering Quarto?

-   After much deliberation I've decided to include today's session in
    the syllabus
-   The assessment for the course will require some interpretation of
    data analysis, and this is not possible with scripts alone.
-   By using Quarto, you'll be able to both analyse and interpret data
    in a single document.
-   Quarto also gives you MS Word like functionality, so it's even
    simpler to use than RMarkdown

# Differences between an Quarto file and an R script {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
R Script (.R)

-   An R script file typically has a .R extension.
-   It contains R code only, without any additional markup or
    formatting.
-   The code is meant to be executed line by line or all at once within
    an R interpreter or environment.
-   R script files are primarily used for writing and running R code,
    without any additional documentation or presentation features.

::: {.column width="50%"}
Quarto file (.qmd)

-   A Quarto file is typically used in the Quarto ecosystem, which is a
    modern, open-source computational notebook system. It allows for the
    creation of dynamic, reproducible documents that combine narrative
    text, code, and output (such as tables, figures, and interactive
    visualizations) in a single document.

-   Quarto files are usually written in a Markdown-based format with
    support for code chunks from various programming languages,
    including R, Python, Julia, and others.

-   Quarto files often include narrative explanations, analysis, and
    visualizations alongside the code, providing a comprehensive and
    interactive document for communicating research findings.

-   The Quarto ecosystem provides tools for rendering Quarto files into
    various formats, including HTML, PDF, and Word documents.

# Getting to grips with Quarto

-   Once you have successfully installed Quarto create an Quarto file
    from the new file option in RStudio.

-   Save the Quarto file (`.qmd)` in your C91AR project (as usual)

-   Make sure the `Visual` option is highlighted in the top left. If you
    have `Source` selected that will take you to the RMarkdown version
    of the document.

# Using forward slash `/`

-   One each new line in a Quarto document you can specify what type of
    content you would like to add by simply typing / and selecting from
    the pop-up menu.

-   In doing so, you can easily switch from writing headings, text, and
    code chunks.

-   These are the three main options you will need, although you will
    see there are a variety of options available.

-   **Note**: there are also many point-and-click editing option in the
    top ribbon. You probably can't see them all on your screen, so it's
    worth maximising the width of the editing window whilst writing.

# Setting up an R report using Quarto

-   In Quarto, your reports will need to include the following at the
    beginning

1.  A code chunk specifying the packages to be loaded.

2.  A code chunk specifying the data to be read in.

-   Click on the cog next to Render and set it to "Preview in Viewer
    Pane".

-   Once you have done this, you are ready to get writing your report.

# A worked example

-   Let's say we wanted to work with the `heights_and_weights.csv` data
    we worked with last week.

-   We know we need to load the following packages:

    -   *tidyverse*

    -   *corrr*

-   So the code chunk(s) to set up this project might look as follows...

# Set up Code in Quarto

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Learning about Correlation through Data Simulation in R

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(corrr)
library(psych)
library(GGally)

# Read in the data
handw <- 
  read_csv("data_raw/heights_and_weights.csv")


```

As this is just the code to set up your report, I wouldn't expect any
additional text to summarise the code.

# Combining code and text

You will however need to combine code and text when you are interpreting
your descriptive and inferential statistics. For the text displayed
here, I am simply entering text directly into the Quarto document: there
is no need to specify a chunk type using `/`.

Here is an example using the function `describe` from the `psych`
package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
# Examine the data
glimpse(handw)

```

The heights and weights dataset contains 475 observations and 2 vectors:
height_in and weight_lbs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}

# Gather means and SDs from data
describe(handw)

```

The mean of height in inches was 62.91 (SD=12.12). The mean for weight
in pounds was 132.28 (SD=54.19). Measures of both skew (-1.78) and
kurtosis (2.89) indicated that height in inches was not normally
distributed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below, I present a histogram of this vector to examine the shape of
height in inches distribution.

```{r}
# Generate a histogram of height in inches
ggplot(data = handw,
       aes(x = height_in)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Hisogram of the distribution of height in inches",
       x = "\nHieght in inches",
       y = "Frequency\n")
```

As you can see from the histogram, height in inches is negatively
skewed.

# Some things to note

-   To generate the document, you need to click on the `Render` button
    in the top ribbon.

-   Render reads from the top down, and this is why we specify the
    packages and data at the beginning.

-   If we read in the data at the end of the document it would not
    render, as would not know what `handw` referred to in the code.

-   I'm still adding comments to my code chunks to maintain a consistent
    narrative throughout the document. This remains an important feature
    whilst writing code in Quarto.
    
# Other things to note

- When you are inserting code chunks, break them up in a logical way, so that each chunk is followed by interpretation text where necessary.

- There's no hard and fast rule here, but I'm generally in favour of smaller, digestible chunks.
