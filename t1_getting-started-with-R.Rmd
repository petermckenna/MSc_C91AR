# Lab Housekeeping

## Using directories with R

-   To reference data or media in R you need to set a working directory
-   You will also be asked to set a directory for installed packages
-   **DO NOT create a folder called 'R'**, as this is the default title R
    gives to its own namespace, which will lead to conflicts and unusual
    behaviour
-   Good practice is to create R projects in designated project folders,
    and I will show you how to do this
-   Creating an `.RProj` creates a project directory, avoiding any
    potential confusion R may experience when switching between projects

## Good practice

-   As well as teaching you how to program in R I will also be teaching
    you good practice in coding.
-   This is because I want your code to be readable to others
-   I want you to take pride in your code
-   The tidier your code, the easier it is to spot typos or to debug
    errors.
-   For ease of interpretation, I will be coding vertically (mostly)
    -   This helps identify any errors or typos and is generally easier
        to read.

## Create installation script

-   In R Studio we write scripts to perform a set of commands
-   To add a script click the Script icon below the File tab (top left)

## Working with RMarkdown

-   RMarkdown allow you to combine code chunks and plain text to produce reproducible scientific reports. 
-   RMarkdown files are edited in the *Workspace Tab* - top left window
-   Create script headings using `#` (called a "comment" or inactive
    code)
-   **To execute code chunks in RMarkdown click the play button**
-   This can be done for single lines, or multiple lines by highlighting
    sections and pressing CTRL(or CMD) + Enter
- The beauty of working in RMarkdown is that you can write text summaries around your code.    
    
## Reflections on today's reading

- https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/programming-basics.html 
- Give you a tour of the RStudio environment
- functions and arguments

```{r functs&args, eval=FALSE}
function_name(argument1 = value, argument2 = value)
```

- set.seed function for reproducibility
