# Lab Housekeeping

## Using directories with R

-   To reference data or media in R you need to set a working directory
-   You will also be asked to set a directory for installed packages
-   **DO NOT create a folder called 'R'**, as this is the default title R
    gives to its own namespace, which will lead to conflicts and unusual
    behaviour
-   Good practice is to create R projects in designated project folders,
    and I will show you how to do this
-   Creating an `.RProj` creates a project directory, avoiding any
    potential confusion R may experience when switching between projects

## Good practice

-   As well as teaching you how to program in R I will also be teaching
    you good practice in coding.
-   This is because I want your code to be readable to others
-   I want you to take pride in your code
-   The tidier your code, the easier it is to spot typos or to debug
    errors.
-   For ease of interpretation, I will be coding vertically (mostly)
    -   This helps identify any errors or typos and is generally easier
        to read.

## Working with RMarkdown

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   RMarkdown allow you to combine code chunks and plain text to produce reproducible scientific reports. 
-   RMarkdown files are edited in the *Workspace Tab* - top left window
-   Create script headings using `#` (called a "comment" or inactive
    code)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **To execute code chunks in RMarkdown click the play button**
-   This can be done for single lines, or multiple lines by highlighting
    sections and pressing CTRL(or CMD) + Enter
-   The beauty of working in RMarkdown is that you can write text summaries around your code.

# What's the difference between R Markdown and R scripts

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**R scripts**

- Purpose: Primarily used for writing and running R code.
- Format: Plain text files with .R extension.
- Execution: Code is executed line-by-line or in chunks, typically within an R environment like RStudio.
- Output: Produces console output, plots, and other results directly in the R environment.
- Usage: Ideal for scripting, data analysis, and running R code interactively.

::: {.column width="50%"}
**R Markdown**

- Purpose: Combines R code with narrative text to create dynamic documents.
- Format: Markdown files with .Rmd extension.
- Execution: Code chunks are embedded within markdown text and executed to produce a final document.
- Output: Generates documents in various formats (HTML, PDF, Word) that include both the code and its output (e.g., plots, tables).
- Usage: Perfect for creating reports, presentations, and reproducible research documents.
