# Lab Housekeeping

## Using directories with R

-   To reference data or media in R you need to set a working directory
-   You will also be asked to set a directory for installed packages
-   **DO NOT create a folder called 'R'**, as this is the default title R
    gives to its own namespace, which will lead to conflicts and unusual
    behaviour
-   Good practice is to create R projects in designated project folders,
    and I will show you how to do this
-   Creating an `.RProj` creates a project directory, avoiding any
    potential confusion R may experience when switching between projects

## Good practice

-   As well as teaching you how to program in R I will also be teaching
    you good practice in coding.
-   This is because I want your code to be readable to others
-   I want you to take pride in your code
-   The tidier your code, the easier it is to spot typos or to debug
    errors.
-   For ease of interpretation, I will be coding vertically (mostly)
    -   This helps identify any errors or typos and is generally easier
        to read.

## Create installation script

-   In R Studio we write scripts to perform a set of commands
-   To add a script click the Script icon below the File tab (top left)

## Working with RMarkdown

-   RMarkdown allow you to combine code chunks and plain text to produce reproducible scientific reports. 
-   RMarkdown files are edited in the *Workspace Tab* - top left window
-   Create script headings using `#` (called a "comment" or inactive
    code)
-   **To execute code chunks in RMarkdown click the play button**
-   This can be done for single lines, or multiple lines by highlighting
    sections and pressing CTRL(or CMD) + Enter
- The beauty of working in RMarkdown is that you can write text summaries around your code.    
    
## Reflections on today's reading

- https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/programming-basics.html 
- Give you a tour of the RStudio environment
- functions and arguments

```{r functs&args, eval=FALSE}
function_name(argument1 = value, argument2 = value)
```

- set.seed function for reproducibility   

# End of session

-   In the lab, we will pick up where we left off and continue to
    develop our existing script
-   Please save your R script for today
-   If you haven't looked at the reading for today

# C91AR \| Housekeeping in R \| Lab

## What we are going to cover

-   Today's lab is a follow on from what we covered in the lecture
-   We're going to go a little deeper into good housekeeping, by
    introducing some of the tidying principles I cover in next weeks
    lecture
    -   setting column data types
    -   generate an overall summary of the data
    -   tidy vector labels
    -   rename vector labels
    -   deal with date vectors

# Setting col types

-   One of the most important things you'll do when reading in data is
    to specify the data type of each column.
-   If you don't do this properly from the outset it can lead to some
    weird behaviour from R later on, and force you to reverse engineer
    your code.
-   Proper use of the `col_types` argument in the function `read_csv` is
    here to help thankfully.
-   This should be used in conjunction with a datasets metadata file, so
    that you know which data type to assign to each vector

<!--

# Expression dataset metadata

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   `ID_` = participant id
-   `sex` = participant sex
-   `eth` = participant ethnicity
-   `eng` = "Is English your native language?"
-   `Exp.date` = date of experiment
-   `interact.before` = "Have you ever interacted wtih a robot before?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   `Alyx.is` = participants guess of robot's gender
-   `item` = plastic food item offered to robot
-   `Expression` = a numeric value for each of the four robot facial
    expressions
-   `resp` = name of the box where participants placed the food item
    after robot expression
-   `Time` = robots onboard clock timer
-   `resp_acc` = accuracy of responses according to theoretically
    deigned expressions
:::
:::

-->

# Data types for the `col_types` argument

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   "l" = logical
-   "i" = integer
-   "d" = double numeric
-   "c" = character
-   "D" = date
-   "\_" = skip
-   "?" = guess
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- For more information see the `read_csv` and `col_types` documentation in the help section
- You can pull this up by running `?read_csv` into the console  
  + I'd recommend consulting the descriptor info at the top then skipping to the examples at the bottom of the help sheet 
:::
:::

# Setting col types within the `read_csv` function

```{r set col types, eval=FALSE}

# Read in data and supply data type argument
df <-
  read_csv("data_raw/robot-expression-data_raw.csv",
           col_types = "ffff?ffffftf")

```


# Summarising data using summarytools::dfSummary

- To run summaryDf() you'll need to install and load `summarytools`
- Based on what we've discussed to this point, how would you go about doing this?

```{r, eval = F}

# Summarise df
dfSummary(df)

```

## Group discussion

- Take some time to interpret the output of `dfSummary(df)`.
- What data types are in the tibble?
- Is there anything *messy* about the data?

<!-- 

```{r, eval = F}
 
# Some examples of Tidy code for R scripts

# Project: Project title
# Outline purpose of script

# load packages
libray(tidyverse)

# keep object names lower_case_and_separated_by_underscores
star_wars <- 
starwars # starwars data is included in tidyverse

# examine data
glimpse(star_wars)

# when the pipeline is to long for one line, place arguments on new line
star_wars |>
  select(name,
         sex
         gender) # select cols name, sex, gender

# Remember, you can also add bookmarks using four dashes to mark different sections and these will appear in the navigation panel next to your script. 


```

-->

# Dealing with awkardly formatted column/vector headings

-   You'll notice that the names for columns (or vectors as they are
    known to programmers) are formatted unusually

```{r head formatting, eval=TRUE}

# Examine vector labelling
names(df)

```

# Inconsistencies worth noting

-   Use of periods and underscore as separator
-   Lower-case and upper-case font
-   Names that lack detail for others
    -   e.g., `resp`; does that refer to the participant response or the
        robot's?

## Load the necessary packages for today

```{r load packages, warning=F, eval = F}

# load packages
library(snakecase) 

```

-   I would add this to your bookmarked "load packages" section at the
    beginning of your script

# Tidying column names with `snakecase` package

- We can use the `snakecase` package to apply uniform formatting to column names
- This addresses the point made earlier about consistent variable names    

```{r tidy headings}

# Tidy column headings using snakecase
  # these functions come from the snakecase package we loaded earlier
names(df) <- 
  to_snake_case(names(df)) # lower_case with underlined separators 

# examine the data
names(df) # notice how the cols are formatted now

```

<!--

# Check-point

-   Be sure to add descriptive comments to your code chunks
-   If you're writing code in R scripts then adding these to RMarkdown, add bookmarks with four dashes after a comment
-   Code vertically by using paragraphs at the end of an argument

-->

# Changing vector names

-   You can also change the names of vectors using the `rename` function
-   Note, `rename` asks for the new vector name followed by the old one
    -   this takes a little getting used to but its simple after enough
        practice

```{r renaming vectors}

# Rename vectors using rename
df <-
  df |>
  rename(perceived_robot_gender = alyx_is, # the new labels are intended to be more descriptive
         robot_expression = expression,
         ppt_acc = resp_acc)

# Examine changes
names(df)

```

- **Remember, using the assign operator as above will irreversably amend your tibble.**
- If you feel this is necessary proceed, but if not consider creating a new tibble object.

# Dealing with the date column

-   Dates are notoriously difficult to deal with in R and our date
    vector could not be read properly
-   Thankfully there is a really useful package that simplifies
    everything; the aptly named `lubridate`
-   It is already loaded as part of the Tidyverse
-   Take a look at [lubridate here](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)

# Lubridate to sort out date column

```{r dates and lubridate}

df <-
  df |> # this is the pipe operator; it means, "then do this"
  mutate(exp_date = dmy(exp_date)) # mutate is a function that allows you to append or modify existing columns/vectors in a dataset

# Examine data
glimpse(df)

```

- The date column should now be properly machine ready formatted (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD), based on the input formatting (i.e., dd/mm/yyyy)
- The machine readable format YYY-MM-DD is preferable for almost all programming languages.
- In this format, you can ask R to make nuanced calculations between dates.

# What did we cover in this lab

-   Setting column data types with the `col_types` argument
-   Generating an overall summary of the data with `summary`
-   Tidy vector labels with `snakecase`
-   Rename vector labels with `rename`
-   Dealing with date vectors using `lubridate`


# Using RMarkdown or Quarto

# Learning about Correlation through Data Simulation

```{r warning=FALSE}

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(corrr)
library(psych)
library(GGally)

# Read in the data
handw <-
  read_csv("data_raw/heights_and_weights.csv")
```

## Examine the data

```{r}

# Examine the data
glimpse(handw)
head(handw)
tail(handw)
```

The heights and weights dataset contains 475 observations and 2 vectors: `height_in` and `weight_lbs`.

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r}

# Gather means and SDs of handw
describe(handw)

```

The mean of height in inches was 62.91 (SD=12.12). The mean for weight in pounds was 132.28 (SD=54.19). Measures of both skew (-1.78) and kurtosis (2.89) indicate that height in inches was not normally distributed.

## Plot the distribution of height in inches

```{r}

# Generate a histrogram of height in inches
ggplot(data = handw,
       mapping = aes(x = height_in)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Histrogram of the distribution of height in inches",
       x = "\nHeight in inches",
       y = "Frequency\n")

```

## Copying and pasting code

```{r}
tibble(
  height_cm = rnorm(30, mean = 179, sd = 13),   # generate data on a normal distribution
  weight_kg = rnorm(30, mean = 78, sd = 5)) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 0) %>%  # remove decimals for simplicity
  mutate(id = row_number())                     # add an id column based on the row number  
```
