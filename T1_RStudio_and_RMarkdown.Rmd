# default for instructor is echo = T; eval = T

# you only want to see the results for certain chunks (e.g., plots)

# What are we going to cover in this Computer Lab?

- Setting up an R Project
- Creating related subdirectories
- Create an R Markdown file
- Add some content to our R Markdown file

# Using directories with R

-   To reference data or media in R you need to set a working directory
-   You will also be asked to set a directory for installed packages
-   **DO NOT create a folder called 'R'**, as this is the default title R
    gives to its own namespace, which will lead to conflicts and unusual
    behaviour
-   Good practice is to create R projects in designated project folders,
    and I will show you how to do this
-   Creating an `.RProj` creates a project directory, avoiding any
    potential confusion R may experience when switching between projects
  
    
# Setting up R Project and Directories

 **DEMO**: Setting up an R Project and directories
- Work in pairs with someone who has done this already at Monday's lecture. 
- Once we have set the RProject up this will be the **primary launch file for this course**

<!-- # Good practice -->

<!-- -   As well as teaching you how to program in R, I will also be teaching -->
<!--     you good practice in coding. -->
<!-- -   This is because I want your code to be readable to others -->
<!-- -   I want you to take pride in your code -->
<!-- -   The tidier your code, the easier it is to spot typos or to debug -->
<!--     errors. -->
<!-- -   For ease of interpretation, I will be coding vertically (mostly) -->
<!--     -   This helps identify any errors or typos and is generally easier -->
<!--         to read. -->

# Working with RMarkdown

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   RMarkdown allow you to combine code chunks and plain text to produce reproducible scientific reports. 
-   RMarkdown files are edited in the *Workspace Tab* - top left window
-   Create script headings using `#` (called a "comment" or inactive
    code)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **To execute code chunks in RMarkdown click the play button**
-   This can be done for single lines, or multiple lines by highlighting
    sections and pressing CTRL(or CMD) + Enter
-   The beauty of working in RMarkdown is that you can write text summaries around your code.

# Setting up an RMarkdown file

- **DEMO**: Setting up an RMarkdown file
- Remember to comment inside chunks and to keep things tidy


# Entering code into code chunks

```{r, eval = F}

# Using operators

3 + 5

12/7

# Assigning variables

x <- 5

7 -> x

```

# Adding formula

- We wrap mathematical formula in double dollars for format it appropriately
- Wrap the following in double dollars to write the formula for simple regression

```{r}

# Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + e_i

```


# What's the difference between R Markdown and R scripts {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**R scripts**

- Purpose: Primarily used for writing and running R code.
- Format: Plain text files with .R extension.
- Execution: Code is executed line-by-line or in chunks, typically within an R environment like RStudio.
- Output: Produces console output, plots, and other results directly in the R environment.
- Usage: Ideal for scripting, data analysis, and running R code interactively.
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
**R Markdown**

- Purpose: Combines R code with narrative text to create dynamic documents.
- Format: Markdown files with .Rmd extension.
- Execution: Code chunks are embedded within markdown text and executed to produce a final document.
- Output: Generates documents in various formats (HTML, PDF, Word) that include both the code and its output (e.g., plots, tables).
- Usage: Perfect for creating reports, presentations, and reproducible research documents.

# What did we cover today

- How to create an R Project
- How to create related subdirectories
- Define and create an R Markdown file
- Run R code in our R Markdown file

# Reminder!

- **Always open the .RProj file for this class**
- Do not open any other file as a srarting point
