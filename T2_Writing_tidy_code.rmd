## Tutorial 2

- Today's lesson is going to include some:
  + General recap
  + Further exploration and applications of the Tidyverse verbs
  + Paired activity

# General Recap

General Recap, a stern, quirky chap,  
Would bellow, "Forget? That's a tactical trap!"  
He drilled through lessons with a comical flair,  
"Lost your memory? Try losing a war—if you dare!"  
His motto remains, a soldier's creed:  
"Recall or retreat—your life may concede!"  

ChatGPT (2025)

# Actual recap

- **Always** open the `.RProj` file to get the session started, as this will load us onto the correct directory where our data is located.
- Create a Markdown file for the activities using the format "LectureX_less_details.rmd"
- Your R Markdown files will contain both text and R code chunks. 
- Make sure you use the `#` key to appropriately header your Markdown file.  
- Make sure you use `#` inside code chunks to provide further code clarification using comments

# Syntax recap 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- `mutate()`: adds new variables or modifies existing variables.
- `select()`: picks (and amends) variables based on their names.
- `filter()`: subsets cases based on specified conditional criteria.
- `count()`:  counts the number of occurrences of unique values.
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- `summarise()`: reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()`: changes the ordering of the vectors.
- `|>`: the **pipe operator** means 'then do this'
- `<-`: the **assign** operator to create new variables or data
:::

::::

# On the assign operator

- What is the difference between these two chunks of code?

```{r}

# Sample 1
short_flights <- 
  flights |> filter(air_time < 60)

# Sample 2
flights |>
  filter(air_time < 60)

```


- What possible challenges might arise from these two approaches?
- How can these be handled in Markdown?


<!--

- When using `<-` and `|>` to modify data objects
- If you want to work on a data file, you must create an object using `read_csv` and specify the related file directory.
- `|>` used to be represented by `%>%`, but both still work.

-->

# Reminder about tidy Code

```{r}

# Strive for:
short_flights <- 
  flights |> filter(air_time < 60)

# Avoid:
SHORTFLIGHTS <- flights |> filter(air_time < 60)

```


# Coding along demo to get us started

- The `glimpse` function is a really nice way to examine the structure of your data

```{r}

# examine data
glimpse(starwars)

# you could also check the related help section
# ?starwars

```

# Quick summary with `summarytools`

- I will sort the installation issue out!

```{r}

dfSummary(starwars)

```


# Data exploration: Count the number of unique species in the dataset

```{r}

starwars |>
  summarise(n_species = n_distinct(species))

```


# Data filtering: Find all *non-human characters who weigh less than 75kg*

```{r}

starwars |>
  filter(species != "Human",  # != denotes "not including"
         mass    < 75)

```


# Grouping and Summarising: Calculate the average height for each species

```{r}

starwars |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) # na.rm = TRUE denotes "remove NA values"

```

# Paried activity

- **In pairs**, I'd like you to write some tidy code chunks with the `starwars` dataset
- This dataset is a part of the *tidyverse* package, so it's already loaded
- You will need to refer to the **Syntax Recap** above to write your code
- So, in your pairs, it would be worth having someone consult the syntax, whilst the other writes the code in Markdown

# Markdown Tasks

- T1: Using `filter`, subset the data so it contains female characters with blue eyes
- T2: Using `summarise` count the number of different planets represented in the vector `homeworld`
- T2: Using `group_by` and `summarise`, calculate the **average height and weight** of each species
- T4: Using `select`, subset the data by `name`, `gender` and `eye_color`
  - You will need to look up how to use `select` for this one


<!--
# when the pipeline is to long for one line, place arguments on new line
star_wars |>
  select(name,
         sex
         gender)





- Now that I've guided you through a set of tidying operations on the data, I'd like for you to have a go yourself.
- Start a new R script called `data_tidying.R`
- I'd like for you read in the tidy data file from our `data_tidy` folder and call it `df` to get started.

#  Task

:::columns
:::{.column width=70%}
- The `robot_expression` column labels are meaningless, and need to be recoded.
- Using what we have discussed this far can you recode the values according to the following criteria:
  + **"1" =  "Head up, jaw drop"** 
  + **"2" = "Upper lid raiser, jaw drop"**
  + **"3"=  "Chin raise, head down"**
  + **"4" =  "Eyes closed, head down"**
- Importantly, I'd like you to create a new vector called `rob_head_exp` in the process of doing so
  + **HINT:** you specify the name of the new col at the beginning of the `mutate` argument
:::
  
:::{.column width=30%}  
- I'd also like for you to `select` the following columns
  + id
  + sex
  + eng
  + rob_head_exp
  + ppt_acc
- Write over the tidy file we create last week

# Situations with many input errors

- The above solution is fine when there are only 3 errors in the input values, but what if there are hundreds or thousands?
- You can use the verbs `case_when` and `str_detect` function to identify string patterns (e.g., the starting letter of a string) and replace values based on the detection criteria.

----

```{r eval=FALSE}

# Using case_when and str_detect to modify rows by string patterns
df |>
  mutate(sex = 
           dplyr::case_when(str_detect(sex, 
                                       "^[Mm]") ~ "Male",
                                str_detect(sex, 
                                           "^[Ff]") ~ "Female",
                                TRUE ~ sex))

# Note: ChatGPT is particularly useful for regex patterns

```

- This might look like a foreign language right now, so let me parse it out for you

# Parsing out the use of `case_when` and `str_detect`

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   `case_when` is like `recode`, only it also requires a conditional
    statement (or an additional condition) in its application.
-   In our case, we want R to look for values that start and end with
    upper and lower case "m" and "f" to to give consistency to the
    "Male" and "Female" labelling in our `sex` vector.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   `str_detect` is a function from the **stringr** package that allows
    you to perform operations on strings in a vector.
-   In this case, we have asked `str_detect` to look for cell values
    that start with an upper or lower case "m" and "f" in the sex
    vector.
-   We then supply the alternate value after the `~` in `case_when`
-   We finish the argument chain by stating that the rest of the values,
    if not matched, come from the sex vector.

# Making use of our new tidy object

- Now that we are happy with our tidied dataset we can start a new script focussed on summarising and plotting the data.
- Before you do though, have a look through your current script, run from start to end to make sure it works.
- Make sure the code is tidy and that you have commented efficiently.
- Once you are happy, start a new script called `data_wrangle`

# Tidyverse verbs

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `select()` picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.
- [More information about Tidyverse verbs here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

# Reading in data for wrangling

- You've probably figured out what we are going to do next
  + read in the tidy dataset into our new script
- This is my preferred workflow in R; to separate *tidying* from *wrangling*
- Note, when I say *wrangling* here, I'm referring to all the operations I might perform on tidy data, e.g., summarising, plotting, analysing

```{r eval = F}

# Wrangling data

# load packages
library(tidyverse) # load in our toolkit

# read in data
df <-
  read_csv("data_out/robot-expression-data_tidy.csv") # don't forget the `.csv` bit!


```

# Filtering data

- Another important operation you will want to do is to filter data depending on a set criteria
- This is easily achieved using the `filter` function
- With filter you specify the vector and value of interest. These must follow the same convention as the data (e.g., labels must match)
- Let's say we only want to look at males whose first language was English

```{r}

df |>
  filter(sex == "Male", # this only works because we have a vector called `sex` which has values labelled `Male`
         eng == "Yes") |>
  print()

```


# `filter` activity

- Can you filter an object based on this criteria
  + **Females**
  + **Asian ethnicity**
  + **Never interacted with a robot before**
- **HINT:** You can examine the names of the levels of a vector using the `unique` function  

## Using `select` to subset data

-   the `select` verb allows you to both select and rename columns (if
    you wish to)
-   You can refer to columns by their name (e.g., "id") or their
    position on the dataframe (e.g., "1")
-   Let's subset the data by native language and response accuracy

```{r}

# label: select

# Subset by native language and response accuracy 
df |>
  select(eng,
         ppt_acc) |>
  print()

```

---

- Sub-setting and renaming can be done as follows

```{r}

# label: select and rename

# Subset by native language and response accuracy 
df |>
  select(native_english = eng,
         participant_accuracy = ppt_acc) |>
  print()

```

# A glimpse into summary chains

- Summarise count of response accuracy by robot expression.

```{r}

df |>
  group_by(robot_expression,
           ppt_acc) |>
  count()

```
