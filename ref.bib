In the context of today’s rapid technological development and its application in a growing array of fields, this role is evolving simultaneously. The present study provides an insight into the current expectations of employers seeking to hire individuals with this job title. It is argued that gaining a better understanding of data scientists’ employability criteria and the evolution of this professional role is crucial. The focus is placed on the desired prerequisites articulated through job advertisements, thus deriving relevant means for furthering theory and practice. It was achieved by harvesting relevant data from job advertisements published on US employment websites, which currently attract the US market’s highest recruitment traffic. The key contribution of this study is to have identified means of systematically mapping skills, experience, and qualifications sought by employers for their data scientists, thus providing a data-driven pathway for employability and avoiding skills gaps and mismatches in a profession that is pivotal in the Industry 4.0.}, number={5}, journal={European Management Journal}, author={Smaldone, Francesco and Ippolito, Adelaide and Lagger, Jelena and Pellicano, Marco}, year={2022}, month=oct, pages={671–684}, language={en} }

Techniques to the Teaching of Introductory Programming}, volume={12},
ISSN={1932-8540}, DOI={10.1109/RITA.2017.2658918}, abstractNote={Over
the past few decades, there has been a movement to try to incorporate
active learning techniques into traditional university classes. The main
idea is that traditional classroom learning is very passive with the
professor lecturing and the students listening. Active learning tries to
engage students with a variety of techniques, which are mainly
variations of traditional teaching techniques. This paper provides an
overview of how active learning techniques might be applied to
introductory programming classes and gives several speciﬁc examples of
how this might be done.}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Revista

 abstractNote={Many initiatives to improve reproducibility incentivise replication and encourage greater transparency without directly addressing the underlying skills needed for transparent and reproducible data preparation and analysis. In this paper, we argue that training in data processing and transformation should be embedded in field-specific research methods curricula. Promoting reproducibility and open science requires not only teaching relevant values and practices, but also providing the skills needed for reproducible data analysis. Improving students’ data skills will also enhance their employability within and beyond the academic context. To demonstrate the necessity of these skills, we walk through the analysis of realistic data from a classic paradigm in experimental psychology that is often used in teaching: the Stroop Interference Task. When starting from realistic raw data, nearly 80% of the data analytic effort for this task involves skills not commonly taught—namely, importing, manipulating, and transforming tabular data. Data processing and transformation is a large and inescapable part of data analysis, and so education should strive to make the work associated with it as efficient, transparent, and reproducible as possible. We conclude by considering the challenges of embedding computational data skills training in undergraduate programmes and offer some solutions.}, author={McAleer, Phil and Stack, Niamh and Woods, Heather and DeBruine, Lisa Marie and Paterson, Helena and Nordmann, Emily and Kuepper-Tetzel, Carolina Ellen and Barr, Dale J.},
