# Outline for today

-   Cover the basics of RMarkdown
-   Show you how this is made easier using Quarto
-   Demonstrate how to compose a Quarto document
-   Code along demo

# Why are we covering RMarkdown?

-   After much deliberation I've decided to include today's session in
    the syllabus
-   The assessment for the course will require some interpretation of
    data analysis, and this is not possible with scripts alone.
-   By using RMarkown, you'll be able to both analyse and interpret data
    in a single document.

# Differences between an RMarkdown file and an R script? {.smaller}

::: {.column width="50%"}
R Script (.R)

-   An R script file typically has a .R extension.
-   It contains R code only, without any additional markup or
    formatting.
-   The code is meant to be executed line by line or all at once within
    an R interpreter or environment.
-   R script files are primarily used for writing and running R code,
    without any additional documentation or presentation features.

RMarkdown file (.RMD)

-   An RMarkdown file usually has a .Rmd extension.
-   It combines R code with Markdown, a lightweight markup language for
    formatting plain text.
-   Can include narrative text, code chunks, and the output of those
    code chunks (e.g., plots, tables) in a single document.
-   Can be rendered into various output formats, such as **HTML**,
    **PDF**, or **Word** documents, which makes them useful for creating
    reports, presentations, and even websites.
-   Popular in data analysis and reproducible research because they
    allow you to integrate code, output, and explanations in a single
    document, facilitating transparency and sharing.

# Getting to grips with RMarkdown

    option in RStudio.
